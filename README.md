# ANDI
This arduino-code is used as a beat generator that plays sound clips from an SD-card randomly to create a rhythm.

Thanks to the Arduino community as a whole and especially to the people behind the TMRpcm repository at: https://github.com/TMRh20/TMRpcm for their Arduino library for asynchronous playback of PCM/WAV files direct from SD-cards.
