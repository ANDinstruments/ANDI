# ANDI
This Arduino code is used as a beat generator that plays sound clips from an SD-card randomly to create a rhythm. The code reads values from potentiometers and a push-button to tweak the beat and generate new rhythms.

Thanks to the Arduino community that made this project possible and a special thanks to the people behind the TMRpcm repository at: https://github.com/TMRh20/TMRpcm for their Arduino library for asynchronous playback of PCM/WAV files direct from SD-cards.
